\section{Problem \#1: Value Iteration Optimization in a Grid
World}\label{problem-1-value-iteration-optimization-in-a-grid-world}}

In this problem we have defined a grid world with a start state at (0,0)
represented by the green square. We have a terminal state represented by
the red square at (7,7). All of the white squares are spaces that we can
be in and the black region is not an available state. This allows us to
set up our state space:

\textbf{State Space:}

I know that the space state is all of the non black spaces, thus we can
set up a conditional state space. First, we will represent a state as a
tuple of ints (int,int) that represent the position on the board
starting from the upper left green corner (0,0) to the lower right red
corner (7,7).

Define: Board Size = n (and ranges from 0 to n). In this case Board size
= 7

Define Function: \textbf{Is\_Space(i,j) \(\to\) (i,j) or None}. This
function takes in a state space and if it is a non black square it
returns the (i,j) state, but if it is a black square it returns none and
is not added to the state space. Thus we can now represent the entire
state space.

For any combination of \((i = 0 \to 7, j = 0 \to 7,)\)

\(\mathcal{S} = \{ (0,0),\) \textbf{Is\_Space(i,j)} \$ (7,7)\}\$

(0,0) and (7,7) are specifically included in this since they are the
start and end states and visually it looks nicer to show the range, I
get that how this is set up the (0,0) and (7,7) term would show up twice
in the state space, so please assume that either the function checks to
see if the state already exists or take the state space to be
\$\mathcal{S} = \{ \$ \textbf{Is\_Space(i,j)} \(\}\) to remove any of
the confusion.

\$\mathcal{T} = (7,7) \$ Set of terminal states

\textbf{Action Space:}

From the problem statement we know that the possible actions that we can
take are (Up, Down, Left, Right) and these represents the actions that
take us to states that are adjacent. However, in this grid world we know
that not all of the states can move any direction. In fact most states
can only move 2 directions, so we need to set up another function that
tells us what moves we can do given that we are in a specific state:

All Possible actions \(\mathcal{A} = \{Up,Down,Left,Right\}\)

Define function: \textbf{Possible\_actions(s)
\(\to \mathcal{A}_{pos} \subset \mathcal{A}\)} Where the function
returns a subset of actions that is less than all the possible actions.
This specifically applies to this grid since none of the states have the
possibilites of doing all 4 actions. The funciton works by checking a
move and determining if the new state that the move takes you to is part
of the state space. if it is then that is an acceptable action. If the
move takes you to a black square then it is not an acceptable action.

Actions per state: \$\mathcal{A}(s) = \$ \textbf{Possible\_actions(s)}

\textbf{State Transition Probability \& State Action Transition
Probability}

Since we know that for each action that we can take only leads to 1 new
state, the transition probability for taking that action given that it
is one of the acceptable actions for that state is always 1 once we have
taken that action.

If s' is adjacent to s in the direction of action a then:

\(\mathcal{P}^a(s'|s) = {1}\) for all \(a \in \mathcal{A}_{pos}\)

else:

\(\mathcal{P}(s'|s) = {0}\)

once we take an action the probability that we transiiton into a single
specific state according to the move is 1. however, if s' is not
adjacent to s then there is no possible way to transition into it

Separately, there is also a state transition probability of the markov
process with equal probability of moving into any ajacent available
space. thus:

\(\mathcal{P}(s'|s) = \frac{1}{\textrm{Number of Possible actions(s)}}\)

\textbf{Reward Transition Function (Each move obtains a reward)}

\$\mathcal{R}\^{}a(s'\textbar s) = -1 \$ and \(\gamma = 1\)

Any transition is a reward of -1 so that the more moves we do, the worse
our reward. Thus we maximize the reward by taking as few steps as
possible and thus the shortest path

\textbf{Reward Transition Function (Only a move into the terminal state
obtains a reward, but it is discounted)}

\$\mathcal{R}\^{}a(s'\textbar s) = 1 \$ if \(s' \in \mathcal{T}\) and
\$\gamma \textless{} 1 \$

The pick for gamma is pretty arbitrary, but it just has to be less than
1 and greater or equal to 0.

\subsection{Problem 1 Part 2: Value
Iteration}\label{problem-1-part-2-value-iteration}}

For this section I will make 2 instances of the FiniteMDP class with
each testing out a different reward method. I will then measure how the
value functions changes with time using the SSE from the previous value
function. The results end up being 17 required iterations for each type
to confirm that we have reached the value function.

\subsection{Problem 1 Part 3:}\label{problem-1-part-3}}

Using the policy\_iteration\_result function I obtained the Optimal
policies and Optimal value funcitions. I have printed out the policies
and they are the same for both. As shown above it takes 17 iterations
for both of the methods to be proven to converge. However, since this
SSE of 0 is when the value function does not change, the actual optimal
value function is found at \textbf{Iteration 16}. This makes sense since
the longest pathway from the green space to the red space is 16 steps.

\section{Problem 2: Value Function
Approximation:}\label{problem-2-value-function-approximation}}

MRP Value Function Approximation. 6 points: Consider a finite MRP with n
states, specified as: (S,P, R, γ) where P represents the
state-transition probability function and R represents the reward
function. Assume there are no terminal states (so, N = S). Assume P is
specified in the usual form as a n × n matrix, and R is specified in the
usual form as a column vector of length n.~We wish to approximate the
value function of this MRP with a linear function based on m features
that are specified as a n × m matrix Φ (each column gives a particular
feature's value for all states, and each row is the feature vector for a
particular state). Give as minimal as possible conditions on the
features matrix Φ such that we can exactly represent the true value
function (These conditions should depend only on given values (S,P, R,
γ)).

\textbf{Understanding the Problem:} ALright, so when I am a little lost
on what to do to solve a problem I find it is useful to just write out
what I am thinking. First I want to go through and visualize all of the
parameters that go into this to help me understand how some of the
matrix math is going to work out. First we have our \emph{State Space}
which is just a list from \(s_1 \to s_n\) where all the states are non
terminal. I don't know if this means that every state has some non zero
probability of going to every other state, or if each state will have
just a few other states it can go to.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S} = \{s_1,s_2,s_3,...,s_n\}
\end{equation}

Next I have the \emph{State Transition Probability Matrix} which hold
values between 0 and 1 and represent the probabilities that a specific
starting state can go to some next state. All of the possible state to
state jumps are included in this matrix as it is \(n\times n\).

\begin{gather}
\mathcal{P} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathcal{P}_{11} & \dots & \mathcal{P}_{1n} \\
\vdots & & \vdots \\
\mathcal{P}_{n1} & \dots & \mathcal{P}_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

From here we have the \emph{Reward Column Matrix} where it is the same
length as each of the states. This reward matrix holds the Reward for
leaving the state that it represents. I have seen some places that it is
also represented as the reward for going into a state, but I think that
the first definition is more consistent with the material we are
learning in this class.

\begin{gather}
\mathcal{R}= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathcal{R}_{1} \\
\vdots \\
\mathcal{R}_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

\(\gamma\) is the dicount factor and really doesn't deserve it's own
visual representation yet. It tells us how much we value future rewards,
but I will bring it back when I write out the value funciton. Actually
let's do that now as it is the next step in this. We can represent the
value function as

\(v(s) = E[G_t |\mathcal{S}_t =s]\) Start with the value function with
reward \(G_t\):

\(v(s) = E[ R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \gamma^3 R_{t+4} + ...|\mathcal{S}_t =s]\)
Replace return with formula

\(v(s) = E[ R_{t+1} + \gamma (R_{t+2} + \gamma R_{t+3} + \gamma^2 R_{t+4} + ...)|\mathcal{S}_t =s]\)
Factor out a gamma

\(v(s) = E[ R_{t+1} + \gamma (R_{t+2} + \gamma R_{t+3} + \gamma^2 R_{t+4} + ...)|\mathcal{S}_t =s]\)
Oh hey look the return function has comeback but not it is the return
for the next state

\(v(s) = E[ R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1}|\mathcal{S}_t =s]\) Replace return
with G\_t+1

\(v(s) = E[ R_{t+1} + \gamma v(\mathcal{S}_{t+1})|\mathcal{S}_t =s]\)
Since we are in an expectation already we can replace the return with
the value function for the next state

Now we have a recursive function that allows us to calculate the value
function of a state as a function of the value function of the next
state. We can understand how to use the Bellman equation is used with
matricies and the probability transition matrix. The equation is
summarized as:

\(v = R + \gamma \mathcal{P}v\)

\begin{gather}
\begin{bmatrix}
v(1) \\ \vdots \\ v(n)
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
R_1\\ \vdots \\ R_n
\end{bmatrix} + \gamma
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathcal{P}_{11} & \dots & \mathcal{P}_{1n} \\
\vdots & & \vdots \\
\mathcal{P}_{n1} & \dots & \mathcal{P}_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v(1) \\ \vdots \\ v(n)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

The reward matrix tells us what the reward is for exiting that state.
\textbf{The Bellman equation is a linear equation and so it can be
solved directly!}

\hypertarget{solution-to-the-bellman-equation-solving-the-value-function-for-all-states}{%
\subsubsection{Solution to the Bellman Equation: (Solving the value
function for all
states)}\label{solution-to-the-bellman-equation-solving-the-value-function-for-all-states}}

\(v = R + \gamma \mathcal{P}v\) Starting with the previous matrix
form\ldots{}

\((1-\gamma\mathcal{P})v = R\): bring over coefficients of the value
function

\(v = (1-\gamma\mathcal{P})^{-1} R\) solve for v since this is a linear
equation

We can solve this directly assuming that the matrix isn't super large.
That is because solving this means inverting the
\((1-\gamma\mathcal{P})\) matrix and multiplying it to the rewards
matrix.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Now I want to get into the actual core of the problem which is the
feature vector \(\phi\) that will be used in linear approximation to
calculate the value function. Soooo, yeah, I'm not going to lie, I am a
little confused on how we determine the minimal as possible conditions
on the feature vector, as it seems like we build this feature vector to
represent components of a state that can not be easily defined. So how
are we building it as a function of the remaining parameters and not the
environment? Like, idk, but we are on an adventure to try and figure it
out. So anyway, the feature VECTOR is a vector (big surprise) for a
SINGLE state that represents conditions of the environment that we deem
important to the state. Like for example, if we were a robot and we are
moving around in a box we might have features like distance to the left
wall, distance to the right wall, or slope of the floor. We try an
capture the environment through these ``features'' since we can't get
all of the possible parameters for a complex environment. We also don't
care about all of the parameters, like the robot doesn't care if the
floor is blue if the goal we are trying to solve for is to navigate. The
feature vector looks like:

\begin{gather}
\phi(s) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\phi_{1}(s) & \phi_{2}(s) & \phi_{3}(s) & \dots & \phi_{m}(s)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

However we are dealing with the Feature MATRIX which (big surprise part
II) is a matrix. Effectively it is the collection of the feature vector
of each of the states stacked on top of each other. thus it looks like
this

\begin{gather}
\phi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\phi_{1}(s_1) & \phi_{2}(s_1) & \phi_{3}(s_1) & \dots & \phi_{m}(s_1) \\
\phi_{1}(s_2) & \phi_{2}(s_2) & \phi_{3}(s_2) & \dots & \phi_{m}(s_2) \\
\phi_{1}(s_3) & \phi_{2}(s_3) & \phi_{3}(s_3) & \dots & \phi_{m}(s_3) \\
\vdots &  & & \dots &  \vdots \\
\phi_{1}(s_n) & \phi_{2}(s_n) & \phi_{3}(s_n) & \dots & \phi_{m}(s_n) \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}

    So how do we actually use this feature vector to get the value function?
Well I will tell you, me. We utilize a weight vector that has the same
length as the number of features. in other words for each of the
features (assuming that the features are numbers) we multiply that
feature by some weighted value that tells us how important this feature
is. this can be expressed like this for a SINGLE state (calculate the
value function for 1 state using the feature vector and weight vector:

\begin{equation}
v(s,w) = \phi(s)^T \cdot w = \sum_j \phi_j(s) w_j
\end{equation}

So now we need to actually build \(\phi\), but in the case of the
problem we need this feature vector to exactly solve the value function.
And we want to do it with as few conditions as possible.

\textbf{Solution:}

So, I think that the way to approach this problem is with eigenvalue
decomposition. Like the way that we solve for the true value function is
by inverting a matrix. And then multiplying by the Reward Vector. Now,
we could use eigenvalue decomposition to obtain the solution to the
inverse matrix. The eigenvalues in this case act like the weights that
we would fit and then the Reward vector would be our feature vector.
Thus for us to map the value function exactly we would need m = n number
of features which represent the n eigenvalues of an \(n \times n\)
matrix.

Optimization}\label{problem-3-career-optimization}}

\subparagraph{Understaniding the
problem:}\label{understaniding-the-problem}}

Alright, I'm not gonna lie these problems are really fun to solve, but
man is this a long problem\ldots{} Any who, let's see if I understand
this problem. Okay, so we have H hours in a day, so we will specify H in
the MDP. Next we can break our day up into different actions. Thus our
action space is broken up into integer amounts of hours to work in a
certain section. Thus a sigle action is represented by 3 numbers. For
each day we get a base reward of the number of hours we worked times the
hours that we actually did work. Makes sense. We also have an integer
wage that can only increase to some maximum wage (we will need to
specifiy this as well). We can get a pay increase according to a poisson
distribuiton based on the number of hours we spend learning and some
random alpha variable (which we will need to specify). Okay, next we
have \ldots{} why tho\ldots{} why add this to the problem :( anyway we
have another option of getting a job offer with probability of
\(\frac{\beta \cdot s}{H}\) that inceases our wage by 1 if it isn't
already the max wage. So in this case anytime we are offered a job we
will take it. thus we can represent this as its own transition
probability. Also we have a discount of \(\gamma = .95\)

\textbf{Parameters:}

H : int (hours in a day)

W : int (Max obtainable wage)

\(\alpha\) : float (multiplying factor for poisson distribution)

\(\beta\) : float (some value bewteen 0 and 1 that affects how often we
get job offers)

\(\gamma\) : float (value between 0 and 1 that represents the discount
factor)

\textbf{State:}

w : current wage

\textbf{Action:}

learn : time spent learning

search : time spent searching

work : Time working

This problem is kinda weird since one of our actions is always dictated
for us. like we always pick the higher wage, which makes sense, but its
odd that we dont let the MDP learn to do that. (tis a trick to throw us
off)

    \textbf{State Space:}

So the state space is represented by whatever integer wage we currently
have.

\(\mathcal{S} = \{1,2,...,W\}\)

\textbf{Action Space:}

The only actions that we can take are deciding what hours to learn,
search, and work each day. However, this should not be thought of as 3
individual actions, but 1 action that is composed of multiple parts. For
example a single action for a 10 hour day would be to learn for 1 hour,
search for 2 hours and work for 7 hours. Thus the action space is a
reflection of the number of permutations of (s, l, H-s-l) where the 3
numbers sum to H. For H = 3 this would be \{(3,0,0) (0,3,0) (0,0,3)
(2,1,0) (0,2,1) (1,0,2) (1,2,0) (0,1,2) (2,0,1) (1,1,1)\}. I'm not
exactly sure how to write permutations in a general form:

\$\mathcal{A} = \$ \{Permutations(Pick 3, sum to H)\}

The actions for a specific state are the same as for the rest of the
states.

\textbf{Reward Space:}

In the reward space the reward for the day will always be the wage that
we have times the number of hours we choose to work. Ths the
optimization problem becomes how fast can we maximize our wage. I think
that I need to break this up into multiple rewards. like a base reward
for having a certain wage and then an additional reward for changing
jobs or getting a promotion. Thus we break this reward into an action
reward and a transition reward.

Reward for taking an action: \(\mathcal{R}^a = \{w*l\}\)

Once we have taken a reward we now have probabilities of being thrown
into new states. These probabilities break down into wage increases with
a new possible state that goes from w to W since x can get you all the
way up to W, but the probability is extremely low. There are also the
possibilities of getting offered a new job.

Reward for getting a new wage: \(\mathcal{R}^a(s'|s) = \{wage(s')\}\)
for \(a \in \mathcal{A}\)

\textbf{State-Transition Probabilities:}

The probability mapping is probably the toughest part of this question
as there are different avenues to get the same state. Specifically the
same wage and wage + 1 states.

\begin{gather}
\mathcal{P}^a(s'|s) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
    \left( \textrm{PMF of Poisson } (\lambda = \alpha \times learn(a), k = \textrm{wage}(s')) +  1 - \frac{B*search(a)}{H} \right)/2 & \textrm{if wage(s') = wage (s)} \\
    \left( \textrm{PMF of Poisson } (\lambda = \alpha \times learn(a), k = \textrm{wage}(s')) + \frac{B*search(a)}{H} \right)/2 & \textrm{if wage(s') = wage (s) + 1} \\
    \left( 1 - \textrm{CDF of Poisson } (\lambda = \alpha \times learn(a), k = \textrm{wage}(s')) \right)/2 & \textrm{if wage(s') = W} \\
    \left( \textrm{PMF of Poisson } (\lambda = \alpha \times learn(a), k = \textrm{wage}(s')) \right)/2 & \textrm{else}
\end{array}
\right\}
\end{gather}

I think that this mapping is probabily best explained with a picture, so
below is how I came up with these probabilities. Effectively for the
first two new states there are 2 ways to get to them and so they have
combined probabilitites. All of the rest of the states only depend on
the poisson contributions since they are the only way to get a higher
wage than w + 1, however with alpha = .08 there is almost no way to get
up that high for most states. The probability to get to any state
becomes the average probability of any method to get to that state.

\textbf{Discount Factor:}

I don't really know what I am suppose to say here. \(\gamma\) has to be
less than 1 or the system will never solve iteratively. \(\gamma\) can
be zero, but it means we dont care about future rewards at all and it
takes away from the usefulness of the problem. But it can still be zero
thus:

\(\gamma \in [0,1)\)

meaning \(\gamma\) can be anywhere between 0 and include zero and 1, but
not inclue 1.

\subsubsection{Explanation for Optimal
Policy:}\label{explanation-for-optimal-policy}}

This policy makes complete sense since you would want to try and get up
to a reasonable wage before you value the money that you get from
working. It also makes sense that we spend the early time learning since
we obtain a higher expected reward than searching near the start. What's
also important is the effect of \(\gamma\) on the wage at which you
switch to searching and then working full time. The closer \(\gamma\) is
to 1 the more valuable it is to continue to search for a higher wage
before working full time. This makes sense because \(\gamma\) is a way
of measuring how far into the future we care about the rewards that we
are getting then. As \(\gamma\) gets smaller we value the money that
would be getting in the near future way more and so the optimal policy
actually shifts to working full time at a much lower wage. In fact if we
take \(\gamma\) to 0 then the optimal policy is to work no matter the
wage, which makes sense since we don't really care about future rewards
and just want to make money now.
